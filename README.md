About
====================
This is a Gameboy and Gameboy Color client/server module for two player head-
to-head games via a serial connection. First version as I recall was written 
around 1993 or 1994 and then later updated in 1999. Someone might find this
useful somewhere in the world.
    
Pre-requisites
====================
1. RGBASM
2. Two Nintendo Gameboys and a serial link-up cable or an emulator that 
   supports that feature.

Using Gameboy LinkUp
====================
1. You're on your own - read the code, fiddle around a bit.

Support
====================
Absolutely none provided.
